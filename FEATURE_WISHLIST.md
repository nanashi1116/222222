### Maps

- Could load higher resolution from asset bundle, as that uses different pipeline, and wouldn't be so slow

### Overlay

- Add option to select a marker and have an overlay UI pointing to the marker

### Immersion and Difficulty

- Tarkov is an immersive game and mod should support players that want to preserve that
- Add additional options that support that:
  - Only show player position if compass equipped
  - Only reveal locked doors that the character has interacted with
  - Only allow map usage if player has map equipped
